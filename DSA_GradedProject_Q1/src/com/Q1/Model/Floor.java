
/*Your friend is a chief architect, who is working on building a skyscraper, in Mumbai. 
The construction is in such a way that the floors will be constructed in other factories and they will be assembled. 
All the sizes will be distinct.

The skyscraper needs to be constructed in N days with the following conditions :

	•	Every day a floor is constructed in a separate factory of distinct size.
	•	The floor with the larger size must be placed at the bottom of the building.
	•	The floor with the smaller size must be placed at the top of the building.

Note: A floor cannot be assembled in the building until all floors larger in size are placed.
As a friend he wants you to build a small program that will help him analyze the construction process, 
to avoid manual work and errors.
